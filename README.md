> **Problem Definition :**

> Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are one of the predominant causes of death globally, approximately 20 million lives each year. There can be a scenario where more than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes. 

> There are a number of factors for deducting decisions for segregating medical reports of patients under a category that might be a daunting task for doctors, which may in turn leave scope of randomizing selection under negligence of some factors. During such instances, there is always a high risk of misclassification of medical conditions of a patient.

> Our proposed model aligns with the concept of dissolving challenges for the health practitioner by recommending individuals exposure to cardiovascular diseases. The concept of our system revolves around the health practitioners to predict the risk for patients to be analyzed with Cardiovascular Disease by inserting the patientâ€™s vitals such as Systolic blood pressure ,Diastolic blood pressure , Cholesterol report, etc.
